				<h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
					<p>
					One of my favorite movies is <span id="favorite_movie">300</span>. This is the movie with the Spartans fighting Xerxes. Here is more information about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/">300.</a> 
					I like 300 because it's full of action and extra dramatic effects. Plus I really like 
					sword fights in movies.

				<h2>Favorite Band</h2>
					<p>
					My favorite artist is <span id="favorite_artist">J. Cole</span>. You can learn more about J. Cole at his website <a href="http://dreamville.com/">Dreamville.com</a>. I like how much I 
					can relate to his songs and how he keeps the negativity out of his music.</span>
